An implementation of paxos algorithm in rust, based on the paper "Paxos Made Simple".

I'm still working on it. It will be uploaded once I finish its sketch.

This project is for learning purpose and praticing my rust programming. Its goal is to implement the paxos algorithm
as is discussed in "Paxos Made Simple", in which every server can start a proposal and finally all servers reach consensus
in a chosen value.
